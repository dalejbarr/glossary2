## tied ranks

<dfn>When two or more values/observations within a variable are identical and assume the same rank order value.</dfn>

This is the default for the `rank()` function (`ties.method = "average"`). You can also set ties to go in the order they are in the dataset (first), in the opposite order (last), a random order (random), all ties have the maximum value (max) or the minimum value (min).

```{r}
scores <- tibble(
  score = c(5, 5, 5, 15, 15)
) %>%
  mutate(
    rank = rank(score),
    first = rank(score, ties.method = "first"),
    last = rank(score, ties.method = "last"),
    random = rank(score, ties.method = "random"),
    max = rank(score, ties.method = "max"),
    min = rank(score, ties.method = "min")
  )
```
