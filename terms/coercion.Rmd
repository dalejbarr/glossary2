## coercion

<dfn>Changing the data type of values in a vector to a single compatible type.</dfn>

If you try to combine values with different [data types](d.html#data-type) in a [vector](v.html#vector) or [matrix](m.html#matrix), they get coerced to a common type. [Strings](s.html#string) are most dominant which means, if you try to combine a string with another data type, the other data type will be coerced into a string. [Doubles](d.html#double) are dominant over [integers](i.html#integer) and [numeric](n.html#numeric) values are dominant over [logical](l.html#logical) values.

```{r vector-coersion}
c(2L, T, F)  # integers and logicals become integers
c(1.5, T, F) # doubles and logicals become doubles
c(1.5, 2L)   # doubles and integers become doubles
c("A", 1.5, 1L, T)  # strings and anything become strings
```
