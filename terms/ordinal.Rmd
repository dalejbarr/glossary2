## ordinal

<dfn>[Discrete](d.html#discrete) variables that have an inherent order, such as level of education or dislike/like.</dfn>

Ordinal variables are not necessarily evenly spaced. That is, there may be a bigger (or smaller) difference between any two consecutive items. E.g., the first and second element on an ordinal variable may be further apart than the second and third; in other words, you can assume 3 is higher than 2 on a [likert scale](l.html#likert), but not by how much, and you cannot assume that 2 is just as far away from 1 as it is from 3. Therefore, think carefully before averaging ordinal values, since the average of 2 and 4 is not necessarily equal to 3.
