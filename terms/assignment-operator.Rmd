## assignment operator

<dfn>The [symbol](symbols.html) `<-`, which functions like `=` and assigns the value on the right to the object on the left</dfn>

```{r assignment-operator}
a <- 1

a
```

The assignment operator can also be reversed

```{r reversed-assignment-operator}
2 -> b

b
```

And even go in both direction at the same time!

```{r dual-assignment}
x <- 2 -> y

x
y
```
