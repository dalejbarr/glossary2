## extension

<dfn>The end part of a file name that tells you what type of file it is (e.g., .R or .Rmd).</dfn>

Common file types and their extensions

| File type                 | extension   |
|:--------------------------|:------------|
| R script                  | .R          |
| R Markdown                | .Rmd        |
| Comma-separated variable  | .csv        |
| SPSS data file            | .sav        |
| Plain text                | .txt        |
| Web file                  | .html       |
| Word document             | .doc, .docx |
| PDF                       | .pdf        |

Often extensions are forgotten when importing files (e.g., reading data files into R) or when exporting files (e.g., saving plots as pictures). 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Always include the correct extension when specifying file names 

# 1) when reading in data files
readr::read_csv("MyTable.csv")

# 2) when saving plots and graphs
ggsave("MyPlot.png")

# 3) when sourcing R code
source("MyCode.R")
```
