## standardize

<dfn> The process of putting [vectors](v.html#vector) on the same scale. In statistics, this often means that a vector has a [mean](m.html#mean) of 0 and a [standard deviation](s.html#standard-deviation) of 1. </dfn>

```{r}
# create a vector containing the numbers 1 to 10
v <- 1:10

# You can standardize a vector by subtracting the vector mean from each value 
# and then dividing each each difference by the vector standard deviation
v_mean <- mean(v)
v_sd <- sd(v)

standardized_v <- (v - v_mean) / v_sd

# Now the mean and standard deviation of the new vector will be 0 and 1
mean(standardized_v)
sd(standardized_v)

# You can also use the scale() function in R to automate the standardization process
another_standardized_v <- scale(v)

mean(another_standardized_v)
sd(another_standardized_v)
```
