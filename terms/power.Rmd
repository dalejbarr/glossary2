## power

<dfn>The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false.</dfn>

Formally, the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis, when the null hypothesis is false. Informally, the likelihood of successfully detecting an effect that is actually there ([Baguley, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2004.01.002)). In its simplest application, there is a relationship between alpha, power, effect size, and sample size. This means we can calculate power if we know alpha, the effect size, and the sample size. This would tell us - in the long run - how many times would I observe a significant effect for a given alpha, effect size, and sample size?
