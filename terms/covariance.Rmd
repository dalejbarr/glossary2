## covariance

<dfn>The relationship two [vectors](v.html#vector) have to each other.</dfn>

A positive covariance means that as one vector increases the other does as well. A negative covariance means that as one vector increases the other decreases. A covariance of 0 means that the two vectors have to relation to each other. 

Covariances can take on any numerical value which can make them difficult to interpret. Because of this covariances are often converted into [correlations](c.html#correlation) by incorporating information about each vectors' [standard deviations](s.html#standard-deviation).
