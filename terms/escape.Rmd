## escape

<dfn>Include special characters like " inside of a string by prefacing them with a backslash.</dfn>

When you need to use a character that has a special meaning in R or markdown, you can create the [literal](l.html#literal) version by escaping it with a backslash.

```{r}
str <- "This prints a \"quote\" and prevents twitter handles like \\@psyteachr from turning into references."
```

`r str`
