## hypothesis

<dfn>A proposed explanation made on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation.</dfn>


In science, hypotheses are based on published literature and theories. In quantitative sciences hypotheses are then evalauted using statistical methods (e.g., glossary("NHST")). Hypotheses are usually not considered in isolation, but in relation to other hypotheses. For instance, if a researchers wants to investigate the relationship between depression and insomnia, they could contrast the following two hypotheses:

A hypothesis describing the researchers' assumption (alternative hypothesis): "People with depression report sleep problems more often than healthy controls."

A hypothesis that refutes the researchers' assumption (null hypothesis): "People with depression report sleep problems as often as healthy controls".
