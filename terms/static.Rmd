## static

<dfn>Something that does not change in response to user actions</dfn>

For example, in a [shiny](s.html#shiny) app, the following code creates static and [dynamic](d.html#dynamic) elements. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
static <- shiny::p("This text cannot change")
dynamic <- shiny::textOutput("This text can change")
```
